## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/cihaneray/torchfetch.git](https://github.com/cihaneray/TorchFetch.git)
cd TorchFetch

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash

```

With theme selection:
```bash
python torchfetch.py --theme dark
```

### Available Themes

TorchFetch offers four visual themes:
- `default` - Cyan labels with purple logo
- `dark` - Blue labels with green logo
- `light` - Magenta labels with red logo
- `monochrome` - Simplified black and white theme

## Information Displayed

TorchFetch displays the following system information:
- Operating System
- Hostname
- Kernel version
- System uptime
- Installed packages (dpkg)
- Current shell
- Screen resolution
- Desktop environment
- CPU information
- GPU details
- RAM size

## Customization

You can modify the torch logo or add additional system information by editing the source code. The logo is defined in the `logo` variable in the `TorchFetch` class.

## How It Works

TorchFetch uses various system libraries and commands to gather system information:
- `distro` for OS detection
- `psutil` for memory information and uptime
- `platform` for CPU and kernel details
- `socket` for hostname
- `subprocess` for package counting and GPU detection
- `screeninfo` for display resolution detection
